This is a simple project using Eclipse to develop for Arduino platforms.

It has been tested using 
- Eclipse Juno
- ArduinoIDE v1.0.2 toolchain and source files
- AVR eclipse plugin v2.4.0

Blink example has been tested on Mega (AT2560) and Nano (AT328P) platforms.

This project is originally a fork of https://github.com/ricovangenugten/Arduino-Blink-Eclipse-Project, but has been refactored and now lives on its own.

For installation steps, see wiki pages (under construction for the moment)
